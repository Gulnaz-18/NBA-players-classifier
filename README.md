Make the classification based on the players' per-game average performance in the 2018-2019 season. The goal is to achieve the best performance by exploring several different classifiers and features. The code demonstrates how to load the CSV file, how to build a classification models, and how to evaluate it. It displays classification model accuracy in several ways, including the accuracy using a 75%/25% training/test split, the confusion matrix and classification report, cross validation results, and so on.
